# Spritecutter

Spritecutter is an OpenCV based utility tool designed to streamline the process of converting sprite-sheets into individual sprites. It is built to help individual animators,
indie game developers and small project developers looking for a quick and easy way to separate multiple sprites. This allows a greater flexibility and efficiency in asset
management. Working on the application itself and more features planned for later.
